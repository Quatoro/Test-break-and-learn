Electronics Study Plan Test, Break & Learn
This document is a practical, progressive study plan for learning electronics. The goal is to build real
understanding through experiments, mistakes, and reflection – not by jumping randomly between topics.

### LEVEL 1 – Fundamentals (DC & Intuition)
- Voltage, current, and resistance
- Ohm’s Law
- Series and parallel circuits
- What ground really is (and is not)
- Labs: LED + resistor, voltage divider, multimeter measurements
- Goal: Understand and build basic DC circuits with confidence

### LEVEL 2 – Power, Energy & Heat
- Power law (P = V · I)
- Heat dissipation in components
- Component ratings and limits
- Labs: comparing resistor power ratings, controlled overload tests
- Goal: Understand why components get hot or fail
### LEVEL 3 – Time, Charge & Reality
- Capacitors and electric charge
- RC time constants
- Pull-up and pull-down resistors
- Labs: slowly fading LED, button debounce with RC
- Goal: Understand that electronics is not instantaneous
### LEVEL 4 – Signals & AC (Intro Level)
- AC vs DC
- Frequency and period
- PWM as an analog signal
- Noise and basic filtering
- Labs: RC low-pass filter, PWM-driven LED
- Goal: Become comfortable with signals and oscilloscope basics
### LEVEL 5 – Active Components
- Diodes in real applications
- Transistors (BJT vs MOSFET)
- Driving loads and protection diodes
- Labs: transistor as a switch, relay or motor control
- Goal: Safely control current, voltage, and power
### LEVEL 6 – Integration & Projects
- Combining all previous levels
- MCU + buttons + LEDs + filtering
- Power consumption and battery operation
- Intentional mistakes and edge cases
- Goal: Independently analyze and debug electronic systems

### Working Method – Test, Break & Learn
For every topic or lab, follow the same structure:
1. Theory – What do I think will happen?
2. Hypothesis – Why should it work this way?
3. Test – Build, measure, observe
4. Result – What actually happened?
5. Reflection – What did I learn?
